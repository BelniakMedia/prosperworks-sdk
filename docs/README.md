# Docs instructions

This documentation was written using Markdown, but the styling used a common
Github theme called [Leap-day] (mostly because its side column with a TOC), and
it's built using [Jekyll], a static site builder that Github supports out of the
box and runs the builds for us.

To keep it simple, you can override CSS rules on `assets/css/style.scss`, and
change some settings on `_config.yml` (i.e. title, theme and some other stuff).

It's not possible to build the page locally, now, but it's probably not hard.
Take a look at this [Github Pages guide](jekyll-local) and the theme README file
to see how to install the needed dependencies and get it running.
